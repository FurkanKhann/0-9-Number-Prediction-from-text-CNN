<h1>0-9-Number-Prediction-from-text-CNN
Project Description
0-9-Number-Prediction-from-text-CNN is a machine learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict numbers (0-9) from textual data. This project provides an efficient method to interpret numerical data from text, which can be useful in various applications such as natural language processing, data extraction, and more.

Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/FurkanKhann/0-9-Number-Prediction-from-text-CNN.git
cd 0-9-Number-Prediction-from-text-CNN
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

Upload Test Images:
Upload your test images to Google Colab. Copy the paths of the uploaded images and paste them into the list named testimg.

Run the Code in Colab:
Paste the following code in a Google Colab notebook and execute it:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the pre-trained model
model = load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')

# List of test images
testimg = ['path_to_image1', 'path_to_image2', 'path_to_image3']

# Function to prepare the image
def prepare_image(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')
    img = img.resize((28, 28))
    img = np.array(img)
    img = img / 255.0
    img = img.reshape(1, 28, 28, 1)
    return img

# Predict and display results
for img_path in testimg:
    img = prepare_image(img_path)
    prediction = model.predict(img)
    predicted_number = np.argmax(prediction)
    print(f'The predicted number for {img_path} is: {predicted_number}')
    plt.imshow(Image.open(img_path))
    plt.title(f'Predicted Number: {predicted_number}')
    plt.show()
View the Results:
The results, including predictions and images, will be displayed within the Colab notebook. For a visual reference, you can view a screenshot of the results here.
